subscription-opml
=================

Put my subscriptions (of podcast and other rss feed) into opml. So I can versioning and sharing my subscriptions.

## Reading feeds ##

I'm currently using google reader as my subscription center for reading. I also use read it later services like [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/) and [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/) (it has lovely Mac client).

Reading is mostly finished in [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/) on iPhone, iPad and my Mac. I occationally use [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/) and [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/) to finish long read. For adding article into Reed it later service I will use sharing menu in [Reeder], or use the best bookmarking service [kippt](https://kippt.com/). The workflow is smooth and fun.

## Podcast feeds ##

I used to finish my podcast download at iTunes and listen them on my iPod/iPhone. But after iOS6 upgrade, the mandatary shift to Podcasts.app kills me. Podcasts.app sucks!!! Podcasts.app rates 1 start on app store, I bet people want to rate it 0 start but can't.

Move to a none-apple solution needs a opml, that helps move you subscription into other apps.
